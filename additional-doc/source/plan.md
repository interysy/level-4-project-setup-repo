# Plan Hello Hello

* String Search Algorithm Visualiser
* Michal Wozniak
* 2554268w
* Gethin Norman

Week-by-week plan for the whole project. Update this as you go along.

## Winter semester

### **Week 1**    
 
* Explore existing solutions, identify postives and negatives - inspiration on what to do  
* Determine requirements 
* Hold first supervisor meeting
* Decide on tech to use 
* Decide on tools to use (VCS , Trello , Reference Manager) 
* Create build and test pipeline   
* Wireframing
* Start writing up analysis 
* Create project skeleton

### **Week 2**  
  
* Wireframing (finish by Tues), show and determine which direction to follow
* Make requirements into user stories (after tues)
* Refine stories into different tasks to complete  
* Finish the analysis section draft
* Think about the overall structure (how to implement observer and strategy pattern) - MVC architecture?
* Explore different libraries to use (Plotly , tracers.js , HTML canvas if webapp) 


* **Week 3** 
  
* Start writing up product design - how is architecture overlooking product and how design patterns are implemented between components 
* Set up of project with the correct architecture and patterns between components 
* Begin implementation on the naive string search approach (this will involve addition of forward / backward button)

* **Week 4** 
 
* Demo progress on naive approach  
* Finish off naive approach taking on any changes proposed by Gethin 

* **Week 5** 
  
* Demo refined naive 
* Testing On Naive 
* Final touches before moving onto the other 2 algorithms

* **Week 6** 
  
* Start implementation on BM   

* **Week 7** 
    
* Demo BM
* Refine BM 
* Testing of BM
* Start KMP implementation   

* **Week 8** 

* Demo KMP 
* Refine KMP 
* Testing Of KMP
* Start implementation of autoplay and pause functionality 
 

* **Week 9** 
 
* Demo current state -> autoplay , forward+back buttons , animations for 3 algorithms 
* Start working on the visualiser of what line of pseudocode is being executed 

* **Week 10** 
 
* Demo 
* Plan for the 2 full time weeks  
* Do some write up on the implementation of the MVP

* **Week 11 [PROJECT WEEK]** 
 
* Any unfinished work or features
* Finish off the implementation of the side by side pseudocode follower 
* Any final touches  
* Messing about with making the app more mobile friendly 

* **Week 12 [PROJECT WEEK]**    

* Implement another algorithm to show the power of the strategy pattern and ease of addition 
* Any extra features agreed if time allows for it
* Status report submitted.
