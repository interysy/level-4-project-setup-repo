# Meeting on 19/09/2023  
All times are approximate.
 
## 12:58 - 13:00 
 
Admin, greetings etc. 
 
## 13:00 - 13:03 
 
My views of the requirements and whether Gethin thinks they're appropriate. 
The following requirements have been uncovered: 
- Web app - easily accessible for students   
- Ability to add new algorithms (subject to finishing the base 3) 
 
## 13:03 - 13:08
 
Current idea of the split window of pseudocode and animator - side by side. Gethin fully happy, suggested adding an animator for the border table and last occurance for animation (for both algorithm and visualiser).  
 
- happy with the dropdown for description 
- happy with having complexity  
- happy with pause and autoplay   
- happy to do this in angular and utilise observer + strategy pattern  
- no backend, fully frontend app
 

## 13:08 - 13:15 
- any vcs is appropriate 
- any license is appropriate 
- private until product finished in march, then can be made public 
- tech is up to me fully - happy to support angular! 
- happy for me to write the background + analysis starting this week, however design+implementation should be done at the very end - he will prompt when 
- not many references will be in this project - happy to just write on paper 
 
  
## 13:15 - 13:20 
- happy with proposed plan 
- this week - wireframe to show gethin and summarise the main requirements 
- this week - create the ci env and testing 
- this week - set up dissertation (can be the same or different repo)
- for tuesday come with proposed wireframes and perhaps a draft of the background if time allows for this 
- stretch goals : set up project skeleton in angular and draw out high level structure of code
